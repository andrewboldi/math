## Ideas
- Based on the slope of the graph, alter the size of the step. E.g., if the slope is 0, you can increase the step size for a larger amount and if the slope is larger, decrease step size.
- Use trapezoid method.
- use Simpson methodo
- Use OP Montecarlo Method
- Approximate the definte integrals by using nested triangles.
