# Integral Approximator version 0

## Overview

This is the baseline file for the integral approximator. It is all based on the idea that integrals can be approximated using rectangles. However, this clear fails at graphs like 1/x since the function diverges as x -> 0- .

## Files

draft.py is a the original rough version of the program and optimized.py is a faster (>0.1 seconds!!) implementation. optimized.py also includes slightly better accuracy with a slightly improved algorithm
